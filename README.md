# LaTeX in oXygen Editor

## About The Project

This repository contains code and instructions for rendering and editing LaTeX equations in the Author mode of [oXygen XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com/) desktop edition. 
To use the code, you must have access to a [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) web service configured to accept LaTeX code as a parameter and return an SVG file showing the rendered math. 
See the following references for setting up such a service: [MathJax web hosting](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/web/hosting.html),  [MathJax general documentation](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/)

Provided in this repository are CSS commands that use custom oXygen functions and Javascript to do two things: 
1. Send LaTeX equations to a MathJax service to return an SVG rendering to the oXygen XML Editor Author environment
2. Create a convenient editing interface for LaTeX equations for the Author environment

The CSS file uses custom functions from the following resource and is configured to obtain math from the XML tag &lt;tex-math&gt;:
